Song Title,Lyrics
How You Remind Me,"Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, ""Are we havin' fun yet?""
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
It's not like you didn't know that
I said, ""I love you,"" and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you
And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, ""Are we havin' fun yet?""
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, ""Are we havin' fun yet?""
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head scream)
Are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head)
No, no"
Far Away,"This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know
You know, you know
I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of Hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all, I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up
'Cause you know
You know, you know
I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
So far away (So far away)
Been far away for far too long
So far away (So far away)
Been far away for far too long
But you know
You know, you know
I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you (I love you)
I loved you all along
And I forgive you (I forgive you)
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me, and never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me, never let me go"
Rockstar,"I'm through with standing in line to clubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want)
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
(Ah, so what you need?)
I'll need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar (Ooh)
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight bodyguards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have the quesadilla, ha-ha)
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
(Does this make me look fat?)
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar (Ooh)
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar"
Photograph,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me"
Animals,"I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing
Screamin'
No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)
So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in
You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin'
No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)
So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in
We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy
When she whispered ""What was that?""
""The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are""
And that was when she started screamin'
""That's my dad outside the car!""
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin'
No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)
So come on baby, get in
(We're just a couple of animals)
Get in, just get in
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Check out the trouble we're in
(We're just a couple of animals)
Get in, just get in"
If Today Was Your Last Day,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
(What if, what if?)
(If today was your last day)
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (What if, what if?)
If today was your last day"
Savin’ Me,"Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees, I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well, I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
All I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And oh, I scream for you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And all I need from you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Hurry, I'm fallin' (Hey, yeah)
And all I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me (Hurry, I'm fallin')
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me"
She Keeps Me Up,"She's got me nervous
Talkin' a hundred miles an hour
She's more than worth it
I swear she smells just like a flower
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her
I love when she says, ""What's wrong with right here on the counter?""
Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
Coca-Cola rollercoaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to
Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister

All night (All night)

I need her so bad
Sometimes I think that I can taste it
This evil romance
So good I never wanna waste it (Yeah)
I can't trust my friends
'Cause she's what everybody chases
And I know where she's been
'Cause it's on everybody's faces
Come on

Lullaby,"Well, I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with the jagged edge
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure you can take this anymore
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Well, everybody's hit the bottom
Everybody's been forgotten
When everybody's tired of being alone
Yeah, everybody's been abandoned
And left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hanging on
Just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone (Oh)
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby (Oh)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby"
Burn It to the Ground,"Well, it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
I got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me
Oh, that shit makes me bat shit crazy
We got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going 'til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh
Ooh
We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me
Oh, we got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going 'til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh
Ooh
Tickin' like a time bomb, drinkin' 'til the night's gone
Well, get your hands off of this glass, last call my ass
Well, no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going 'til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight

Figured You Out,"I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favourite damn disease
And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed
While you put me to the test
I like the white stains on your dress
And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck
And I love your lack of self-respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
(Why not before? You never tried)
(Gone for good, and this is it)
I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease
And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose

Someday,"How the hell'd we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able to see the signs that we missed?
And try to turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists and unpack your suitcase
Lately, there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late
Nothing's wrong
Just as long
As you know that someday I will
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
Well, I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror
Nothing's wrong
Just as long
As you know that someday I will
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now

Something in Your Mouth,"Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body
They say it’s over budget, but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene
If Hollywood had called her, she'd be gone before you hollered, come on
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along
(You naughty thing)
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
(You naughty woman)
You shake your ass around for everyone
(You’re such a mover)
I love the way you dance with anybody
(The way you swing)
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth
Crafty little lip tricks
Tattoos on her left hip
She bending as you’re spending
There’s no end to it, so baby, come on
Dressed up like a princess
Betting that her skin smells better
Than the scent of every flower in the desert, come on
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along

You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey

You shake your ass around for everyone

I love the way you dance with anybody

And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth
She loves the night scene bar queen
Living for the fun taking over every dance floor like she's the only one
In the spotlight all night dissing everyone
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb
(You’re so much cooler) When you never pull it out
(So much cuter) With something in your mouth
(You naughty thing)
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
(You naughty woman)
You shake your ass around for everyone

When We Stand Together,"One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win
They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong?
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
The right thing to guide us
Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on
(Just like a heartbeat)
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in

Hand in hand forever

If Everyone Cared,"From underneath the trees
We watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight
Singing, Amen, I
I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I
I am alive
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day, when nobody died
And I'm singing
Amen, I, Amen, I
I am alive
Amen, I, Amen, I, Amen, I
I am alive
And in the air, the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along
Singing Amen, I
I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I
I am alive
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
When nobody died
And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day when nobody died (Died)"
Feed the Machine,"Addressing those beneath from high above
Convincing his belief for what you love
Baiting every hook with filthy lies
Another charlatan to idolize
Is this suppression just in my mind? (Just in my mind?)
No more questions, get back in line! (Just get back in line!)
You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (Picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (To feed the machine)
The gears forever turn to grind the mice
Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
Power absolutely all for show
The piper blows his flute and off you go
Is this obsession behind your eyes? (Behind your eyes?)

Never Again,"He's drunk again, it's time to fight
She must have done something wrong tonight
The living room becomes a boxing ring
It's time to run when you see him
Clenching his hands
She's just a woman
Never again
I hear her scream, from down the hall
Amazing she can even talk at all
She cries to me ""Go back to bed""
I'm terrified that she'll wind up
Dead in his hands
She's just a woman
Never again
Been there before, but not like this
Seen it before, but not like this
Never before have I ever
Seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never again
Just tell the nurse you slipped and fell
It starts to sting as it starts to swell
She looks at you, she wants the truth
It's right out there in the waiting room
With those hands
Looking just as sweet as he can
Never again
Seen it before, but not like this
Been there before, but not like this
Never before have I ever
Seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never again
Never again
Father's a name you haven't earned yet
You're just a child with a temper
Haven't you heard ""Don't hit a lady""?
Kicking' your ass would be a pleasure
He's drunk again, it's time to fight
Same old shit, just on a different night
She grabs the gun, she's had enough
Tonight she'll find out how fucking
Tough is this man
Pulls the trigger as fast as she can
Never again
Seen it before, but not like this
Been there before, but not like this
Never before have I ever
Seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never again
Seen it before, but not like this
Been there before, but not like this
Never before have I ever
Seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again"
Too Bad,"Fathers hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field
And mothers hands are serving meals
In a café on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
(Let's talk)
You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Long time, let's walk, let's talk"
Home,"Lying awake, did it again for Christ's sake
Shoulda told her to go, and I know it
But she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home
I did what I did, can't say ""hey man, I'm just a kid.""
Saw the lie in my eyes, couldn't hide it
Cause she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home
Oh
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home
The pain in my heart's 'cause we're a thousand miles apart
I've got no one to blame for the shame
'Cause she's waiting back home
I hope she's waiting back home
Stupid to think that I could blame it on the drink
Now I'm trying to stall, making calls to someone back home
I hope there's someone back home
Oh
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home
I walk through the door and there's no light on anymore
Must have known all along I was wrong
Cause there's no one at home
No one's waiting back home
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home"
Song on Fire,"The first words that come out
And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on
The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one I'm standing on
I write lines down, then rip them up
Describing love can't be this tough
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along
I write lines down, then rip them up
Impossible describing love
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this
I wanna sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this"
Gotta Be Somebody,"This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Ooh, you can't give up (When you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough ('Cause you never know)
When it shows up (Make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one
The one you're waiting on
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh
Nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there (When you're looking for)
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares ('Cause you never know)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (Make sure you're holding on)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there"
S.E.X.,"""No"" is a dirty word, never gonna say it first
""No"" is just a thought that never crosses my mind
Maybe in the parking lot, better bring your friend along
Better off together than just one at a time
S is for the simple need
E is for the ecstasy
X is just to mark the spot
'Cause that's the one you really want
(Yes!) Sex is always the answer; it's never a question
'Cause the answer's yes, oh the answer's yes
Not just a suggestion if you ask the question
Then it's always yes, yeah!
I'm loving what you wanna wear, I wonder what's up under there?
Wonder if I'll ever have it under my tongue?
I'd love to try to set you free, all of you all over me
Love hearing the sound you make the second you're done
S is for the simple need
E is for the ecstasy
X is just to mark the spot
'Cause that's the one you really want

I’d Come for You,"Just one more moment, that's all that's needed
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it
I can’t believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground
But it doesn't matter 'cause I've made it up, forgive me now
Every day I spend away, my soul's inside out
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
I finally know just what it means to let someone in
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone
I'd search forever just to bring you home
Here and now, this I vow
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you
Yes, I'd come for you, no one but you
Yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you
I'd crawl across this world for you
Do anything you want me to
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you
You know I'll always come for you"

Never Gonna Be Alone,"Time is going by so much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you
Now I'm wondering why I've kept this bottled inside
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know
You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
You're never gonna be alone
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on
We’re gonna take the world on
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone
Oh!
You've gotta live every single day
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun
Every single day
Maybe our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Tomorrow never comes
Time is going by so much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you
You're never gonna be alone

If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on
We’re gonna take the world on

This Afternoon,"{Inaudible Chatter}
Ohh!
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
{Laughter}
Sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
(Last call, you sons of bitches!)
Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
(Drinks on the house!)
Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon"
Trying Not to Love You,"You call to me, and I fall at your feet
How could anyone ask for more?
(How could anyone ask for more?)
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?
(How could anyone ask for more?)
But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
And trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more
And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go)
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go)
But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did? Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, whispered right in my ear
Said, I've been dying to tell you
Trying not to love you, only went so far
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining, from what we're fighting for
We just keep on trying, we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more"
San Quentin,"Let's get this circus on down the road
We're takin' bets how far a tank of gas will go
Call up your best friend, then call two more
About to do some shit that you ain't seen before
There ain't no backdoor, there ain't no sign
Location changes almost every other night
Last time we found it, can't remember much
I thought I was a God until my lawyer woke me up and said
I testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Got out on bail, we hit the town
Somebody told me we should burn it to the ground
Too many favors, too much to drink
Come 6 AM, they had me back inside the clink
I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Tough to find, a goddamn alibi
Wrong or right, it's tough to justify
Can't dismiss, too many witnesses
When insanity's the pattern, it don't matter what it is
I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?"
After the Rain,"All your life, scramble and scurry
Take your time, rather than hurry
Never too late to write the best of your story
Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry
Life's no race, it's a companion
Always face with reckless abandon
The ticket to life as my mother once told me
Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely (gonna be lonely)
Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain
Spend your days happy and grateful
Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful
Every good thing will come in moderation
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
Choose your friends, carefree and kindly
Choose your words, careful and wisely
Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder
One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older)
Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain
All mistakes, committed upon us
Always take a toll on the conscience
Every regret is a debt that you live with
Never forget to remember forgiveness
Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Rain, yeah
Ra-ai-ai-ain
Gonna have to come after the rain"
Satellite,"I know it's late, but something's on my mind
It couldn't wait, there's never any time
'Cause life slips by without a warnin'
And I'm tired of ignorin'
All the space that's between you and I
Let's lock the door behind us
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you
Go 'til the morning light
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Do you recall how long it must have been
Since any room held only you and me?
And every song that sings about it
Says that we can't live without it
Now I know just what that really means
Let's lock the door behind us
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you
Go 'til the morning light
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance with me around the moon (You and I, every night)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
I can't believe the days turn into years
I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight, the sand is stoppin'
Take the hourglass and drop it
So we can stay inside this atmosphere
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Dance with me around the moon (You and I, every night)
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite)
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite)
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite)
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite)"
Next Contestant,"I judge by what she's wearing
Just how many heads I'm tearing
Off of assholes coming on to her

And I wish she'd take the night off
So I don't have to fight off
Every asshole coming on to her
It happens every night she works
They'll go and ask the DJ
Find out just what would she say
If they all tried coming on to her

They think they'll get inside her
With every drink they buy her
As they all try coming on to her

They're cool, but twice as crazy

Side of a Bullet,"Uncle Sam taught him to shoot, maybe a little too well
Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet
He hit the stage so full of rage And let the whole world know it
Six feet away, they heard him say ""Oh God, don't let him pull it""
""Please God, don't let him pull it""
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched you do it
How could you take his life away? (What made you think you had the right?)
How could you be so full of hate? (To take away somebody's life)
And when I heard you let him die and made the world all wonder why
I sat at home and on my own, I cried alone
And scratched your name on the side of a bullet
And in the wake of his mistake So many lives are broken
Gone forever from a loaded bullet
And no excuse that you could use Could pull somebody through it
And to this day so many say, ""God why'd you let him do it?""
How could you let him do it?
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched him do it
How could you take his life away? (What made you think you had the right?)
How could you be so full of hate? (To take away somebody's life)
And when I heard you let him die and made the world all wonder why
I sat at home and cried alone
And on my own, I scratched your name on the side of a bullet
How could you take his life away? (What made you think you had the right?)
How could you be so full of hate? (To take away somebody's life)
And when I heard you let him die and made the world all wonder why
I sat at home and cried alone
And on my own, I scratched your name on the side of a bullet
On the side of a bullet
On the side of a bullet
On the side of a bullet"
Those Days,"Remember when the streetlights came on and we had to be home?
Remember when Elm Street came on? Couldn't watch it alone
Remember every prank call we made and star-sixty-nine?
Remember tryna hit eighty-eight to go back in time?
Remember when they played ""Purple Rain"" to our first slow dance?
Remember when we thought that first base was just holding hands?
Those days come back in the dead of night
Those days that felt like another life
What would you be doin' back in those days?
We'd be turnin' up the stereo
And play it everywhere we'd go
And so did everyone we'd know in those days
And everybody got to fall in love
With every movie made for us
God, I couldn't get enough of those days
Remember every poster we had hangin' on the wall?
Remember every T-shirt we stole from the local mall?
(""Ace of Spades"" by Motörhead)
Remember Guns n' Roses came out? We were standin' in line
Remember front row at that show? Camped out all night
(Got so high, ""Sweet Child O' Mine"")
Those days come back in the dead of night
Those days that felt like another life
What would you be doin' back in those days?
We'd be turnin' up the stereo
And play it everywhere we'd go
And so did everyone we'd know in those days
And everybody got to fall in love
With every movie made for us
God, I couldn't get enough of those days
The time we'd waste 'cause life could wait
What we'd give to relive just a single day
The time we'd waste 'cause life could wait
What we'd give to relive just a single day
Instead of turnin' the page
We'd be turnin' up the stereo
And play it everywhere we'd go
And so did everyone we'd know in those days
And everybody got to fall in love
With every movie made for us
God, I couldn't get enough of those days
(Oh) Those days that felt like another life
(Oh) Those days come back in the dead of night
(Oh) Those days that felt like another life
(Oh) What would you be doin' back in those days?"
Shakin’ Hands,"(Hey, hey)
She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
You grow up quick when you grow up poor
It's the only way to LA that she knows
The Hollywood pose: teeth, tits, and toes
It didn't take her long to leave the boulevard
So many Five Star friends with black credit cards
She'd try anything once
'Cause anything goes
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold
(Hey, hey)
Well, she ain't no Cinderella
When she's getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
(Hey, hey)
I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
City Hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look
Every A-List player is her favorite friend
Since they all taste the same in the back of the Benz
A congressman would call her every once in a while
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
She'd done everyone once and everyone knows
You gotta get a little dirty when you're digging for gold

Well, she ain't no Cinderella

Well, someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest
Yeah, he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can

Rockstar Sea Shanty,"I'm through with standing in line to pubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
Life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be
Tell me what you want
I want a huge sail that'll hold the squalls
And a big black ship with some cannonballs
Don't wanna join Davy Jones twenty thousand leagues under the sea
So how you gonna do it?
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even grow my beard and change my name, we
We all just wanna be big rockstars
Live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come еasy and the drugs come cheap
Wе all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIPs with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a rum dealer on speed dial
Hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Singing those songs that offend the censors
Popping my pills from a Pez dispenser
(Rockstars don't do mornings)
Get washed up sailors writing all our songs
Get washed up sailors writing all our songs
Lipsync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
We'll sing them dusk till morning, we, we

Coin for the Ferryman,"Flying down the highway like a bat out of hell
My buddy Bradley's in the middle
Darcy's lookin' out the window
We just got high and hopin' no one can tell
But with the icky of the sticky
It don't matter where the wind blows
Lighter in my hand and I've got nothing to burn
Except a little turpentine inside of those five paint cans
Get grandpa's shotgun and we'll all take turns
But don't you ever say a word
Cause you know momma's gonna hate that
The dice that we've been rollin'
With our lives are better stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
In three, two, one
We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman
Countin' every nickel, dime and five dollar bill
So we've been stealin' gasoline and laying low out on the backroads
The city lights are glowin' over the hill
And we can make it, but we take the chance of never coming back home
The dice that we've been rollin'
With our lives are better stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
In three, two, one
We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light

If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman
One for the road and one for those in heaven
One for the lord and take it from the devil
Don't even try, 'cause you know you can't hide
Better run, better run, better run
We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite

Million Miles An Hour,"I can taste the color of the lights
Take one of those and two of these
Then watch the walls begin to breathe
I can taste the color of the lights
Wings are growing out of me
The floor is floating underneath
I can see the future burning bright
Future burning bright
The ceiling has us mesmerized
It feels like we could never die
Heading for the dark side of the moon
As we lift off into the sky
Invincible and so alive
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The universe just started slowing down
Yet suddenly we're traveling
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
When shadows soon start breaking free
No longer held by gravity
(How did we get so far from the ground?)
Speaking to the galaxy
Received and sending back to me
I can finally hear the speed of sound
Speed of fucking sound
I like this everlasting pill
'Cause time itself is standing still
Why's the room still spinning just the same?
Turn off your phone so no one calls
'Cause you and I are tripping balls
I can still hear ringing in my brain
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
See no signs of ever coming down
Yet suddenly we're traveling
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The particles are dancing all around
I can't deny the hardest thing for me
Is finding time to finally breathe
See no signs of ever coming down
Another wave is coming in
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour"
The Betrayal (Act III),"Table has been set
Serving up the worst regret
Waiting for the chance
Serpents love the circumstance
Speaking to the sky
Sleight of hand and cheap disguise
Naming of your price
Payment for the sacrifice
Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You've brought the wolves right here
You've brought the kiss of death
You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)
The moment we've all been waiting
No one can save him (No one can save...)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (No need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)
Committed to your task
Jealousy behind your mask
Pieces are in place
Thirty for your last disgrace
Holding of your tongue
Dealings that can't be undone
Blood over your hands
Pawn inside the master plan
Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You brought the wolves right here
You brought the kiss of death
You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)
The moment we've all been waiting
No one can save him (No one can save...)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (No need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)
What have you gained?
What have you done?
Nothing but shame and there's nowhere to run
Who takes the blame?
Why have they come?
What in God's name have you done?
You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)
The moment we've all been waiting
No one can save him (No one can save...)
You won't believe until he's gone
Go on, go on
Your noose is waiting (No need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)
You just betrayed
You just betrayed
You just betrayed
You just betrayed"
Every Time We’re Together,"I'm back in my hometown
And Main Street's dying now
It's like there's nothing left of it
No more high school grounds
They tore that building down
And everything with it I miss
I call up my old friends
So lost since I've seen them
Feels like we're back there instantly to me
We'd all meet at Shawn's
The backyard fire's on
And we'd start telling tales of how life used to be
The years have come and gone
But these stories carry on
Looking back, they're better than they used to be
'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
And the story goes on, and gets a little better
Every time we're together
It's funny how we change
And some things stay the same
God, I miss the glory days, always
Daylight getting near
We shed a few more tears
Lord, I love the memories we've made
The years have come and gone
But the stories carry on
Looking back, they're better than they used to be
'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
And the story goes on, and gets a little better
Every time we're together
Well, you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
And the story goes on, and gets a little better
Every time we're together
And the story goes on, and gets a little better
Every time we're together"
Just to Get High,"He was my best friend
Well, I tried to help him
But he traded everything for suffering
And found himself alone
I watched the lying turn into hiding
With scars on both his lips, his fingertips were melted to the bone
But I can still remember what his face looked like
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now
A gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
To get high-igh, -igh, -igh (High-igh, -igh, -igh)
Three days no sleeping
Well, he gave up eating
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing
And pretended not to know
He started stealing, to supply the feeling
Found out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife
And held it to her throat
But I can still remember what his face looked like
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now
A gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
To get high (High)
Tell me what you did, where you gone and hid?
Show me is what you really want, watching what you've got
Slowly
Circling the drain, throw it all away
Just to get high (High)
High-igh, -igh, oh
(High-igh-igh-igh, high-igh-igh-igh)
High
(High-igh-igh-igh, high-igh-igh-igh)
High
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now
A gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
Just to get high-igh, -igh, -igh (High-igh, -igh, -igh)
Tell me what did, where you gone and hid?

Silent Majority,"How could this affect my life?
How could I affect the outcome?
So why even try; for what, for what, for what, for what?
A coward can save the day
When the bravest of men just stand by
So easy to say; so what, so what, so what?
So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored?
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?
A candle's the smallest light
But a handful becomes a lighthouse
Cutting the night for us, for us, for us, for us
The one with the loudest voice is rarely the one to follow
Silence the noise; so what, so what, so what?
So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored?
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
What if we, what if we, what if we...
So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored?
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?
Hurry up, the world needs this
Hurry up, the world needs this (the world needs this)

Miss You,"I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so...
I just woke up from a dream today
Time gone by, but you still look the same
Felt so real to have you back with me
It's just too bad it's just another dream
(Gimme just one wish)
If I could give it all away, I'd do it just for one more day
I thought I had the time to wait, now it's too late to tell you that I...
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do (I miss you so much)
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do (God knows I do, I...)
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do (I miss you so much)
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do
After dark, laughing in the rain
Silver heart locket on a chain
Well, pictures fade and silver turns to grey
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away
(Gimme just one wish)
If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
And trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told you
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you that I...
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do (I miss you so much)
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do (God knows I do, I...)
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do (I miss you so much)
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do
If there was some way, you know I would
I'd do it today, I wish I could
I call out your name, it does no good
I wish I knew what would
I, I miss you so much
God knows I do
I, I wish my wish was enough
(Gimme just one wish)
If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
And trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told you
All the things I left unsaid
I'd live to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you that I...
I miss you so, so I do
I miss you so, so I do (I miss you so much)
I miss you so, so I do

Get ’Em Up,"His driver’s license said James, he went by Jim
A gangster wannabe, and baby, that was him
He stole his uncle’s 44 last Friday night
Said if I wanted in, we’d have to plan this thing just right
We’ll need the gloves, we’ll need the bags, a couple masks
We’ll need to steal a car with windows tinted black
We picked the nearest bank on Main and 17th
We wrote down every line from every movie that we’d seen
Screamin'...
This is a robbery, now get down on the floor
We’re here for all the shit that you don’t need no more (Yeah)
We want your cash, open the safe, get off your phone
Don’t be a hero and you might just make it home
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Get 'em, get 'em up
A freshly stolen Mustang, small block 302
Drove past the bank a dozen times this afternoon
The only parking spot was half a block away
Gave us time to practice just exactly what to say
Screamin'...
This is a robbery now, get down on the floor
We’re here for all the shit that you don’t need no more (Yeah)
We want your cash, open the safe, get off your phone
Don’t be a hero and you might just make it home
Get 'em up

Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
Get 'em, get 'em up
Get 'em, get 'em up
The only thing I wish that one of us had known
That it was Sunday and the goddamn bank was closed
Too bad we didn’t see the cops across the street
We dropped our guns and tried to run and there went all our dreams of screamin'...
This is a robbery, now get down on the floor
We’re here for all the shit that you don’t need no more (yeah)
We wanted easy, straight and now we’ll never know
Somebody call my mom and tell her I ain’t coming home
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get 'em up
And get down
Reach for the sky
Then go ahead and kiss the ground

Next Go Round,"I wanna do it 'til the sun comes up
'Til we're both so good and sweaty that we can't stand up
I wanna do it till we're both about to drop
As long as we're caught in together then we're never gonna stop
I wanna go until the neighbors all complain
Beause they heard somebody screaming and they think we're both in pain
I wanna go so long your parents think you died
They’re gonna call the cops, the CIA, and then the FBI
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down
(Hold on, here we go)
Yeah, we're gonna go until our legs give out
('Round and 'round we go)
Yeah, we're gonna do it hanging upside down
(Up and down we go)
Yeah, we're getting ready for the next go 'round
'Round and 'round we go
Shut the windows, lock the door, unplug the phone
For all intents and purposes, there ain't nobody home
Then we can do it till the batteries are gone
And borrow two from the TV remote to throw this thing back on
I wanna cover you with jello in the tub
We can roll around for hours without ever comin' up
I want you naked with your favorite heels on
Slap John Deere across my ass and ride me up and down the lawn
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down

Feelin’ Way Too Damn Good,"I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me

For 48 hours, I don't think that we left my hotel room
(Left my hotel room)
Should show you the sights 'cause I'm sure that I said that I would
(I said that I would)
We gotta make love just one last time in the shower
Well, something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good
And it's like, every time I turn around
I fall in love and find my heart face down and
Where it lands is where it should (Oooh)
This time it's like
The two of us should probably start to fight
'Cause something's gotta go wrong, 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good, oh
Feelin' way too damn good
Sometimes I think best if left in the memory
(Left in the memory)
It's better kept inside than left for good
(Than left for good)
Looking back each time they tried to tell me
Well, something's gotta go wrong, 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good

I fall in love and find my heart face down and
Where it lands is where it should (Oooh)

Because of You,"Hands on the mirror, can't get much clearer
Can't make this all go away
Now that you're bleeding, you stare at the ceiling
Watch as it all fades away
From what you do, because of you
You know I can't be there
Each time that you call
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eye
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die
From what you do, because of you
What you do, what you do
What's become of you?
What you do, what you do
What's become of?
Now that you did this, you ask for forgiveness
Doctor, could you be my priest?
You say you're mistaken, but look what you've taken
You laugh as you lie through your teeth
From what you do, because of you
You know I can't be there
Each time that you call
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all
I know by the look that I see in your eye
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die
From what you do, because of you
What you do, what you do
What's become of you?
What you do, what you do
What's become of?
From what you do
Hands on the mirror, can't get much clearer

Leader of Men,"Tell your friends not to think aloud
Until they swallow
Whisper things into my brain
Your voice sounds so hollow
I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow?
So hard to swallow
So turn the television off
And I will sing a song
And if you suddenly have the urge
You can sing along
I touch your hand, I touch your face
I think the fruit is rotten
Give me lessons on how to breathe
Because I think I've forgotten
I think I've forgotten
One day, out to a cliff
That overlooks the water
I jumped in to save a girl
It was somebody's daughter
And now the ring that's on my hand
It was given to me by her
And to this day we all sit around
And dream of ways to get higher
To get much higher
Tell your friends not to think aloud
Until they swallow
Whisper things into my brain
Your voice sounds so hollow
I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow?
So hard to swallow"
High Time,"Same old, same town
Going nowhere
Need a brand new view in front of me
Don't need no map, no need to pack
And don’t care much if we come back
Sitting still just wasn't meant for me
Some folks just go straight and narrow
Turns out that life ain't right for me
'Cause every time we cross state lines
The grass we find on the other side
Always seems to twist up twice as green (Hey!)
Well it's high time you and I got rollin'
Some place else we just gotta be
That beat up van I bought you thought was stolen
Looked like hell but felt like home to me
Strummin’, thumpin’ on the dashboard
Purple haze makes it hard to see
Two rearview dice, three friends of mine
And four bald tires still rollin' right
Taste of inspiration's all we need (Hey!)
Well it's high time you and I got rollin' (Like a rollin' stone)
Some place else we just gotta be
That beat up van I bought you thought was stolen (Ain't been stolen long)
Looked like hell but felt like home to me
Eagles got us down to California (Song's we're singing on)
Beach Boys got us surfin' on the sea
We got stoned goin' up to Colorado (We been smokin' on)
And couldn't see the forest for the trees
Better take a picture
'Cause, baby, I can betcha that we won't be 'round here for long
Freedom train keeps movin' on
Stoppin' off and take it slow
Top it off when we get low
Only way that this can last
If you got ass, the grass, or gas
Clappin', tappin'
Get your groove on
Front seat drums and backseat harmonies
When we drive by your countryside
Stick out your thumb if you need a ride
No one knows just where this road will lead (Hey!)
Well it's high time you and I got rollin' (Like a rollin' stone)
Some place else we just gotta be
That beat up van I bought you thought was stolen (Ain't been stolen long)
Looked like hell but felt like home to me (Woo!)
Eagles got us down to California (Song's we're singing on)
Beach Boys got us surfin' on the sea
We got Rocky Mountain high in Colorado (We been smokin' on)
And couldn't see the forest for the trees"
Flat on the Floor,"Not like I need to depend upon anyone
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
One more anthem for the know-it-all
I won't be standing up for long
I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor
Like I need to defend my own innocence
So what, I did it, I admit it, and I'm pleading the 5th
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long
I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl
In ten minutes, I'll be laying out flat on the floor
Eight minutes from losing it a little bit
Five minutes, your description might be starting to fit
Three to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known
I won't be standing up for long
I better learn how to crawl
Not like I need to depend upon anyone
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long
I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor
I can't stand up at all
Can't see nothing at all
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor"
Woke Up This Morning,"I paid my last respects this mornin' on an early grave
Already said goodbye, nothin' left to say
A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent
Not how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this
Well, I'm hating, all of this
I'm hating, all of this
All of this, all of this
Now I know why, I hide my love from you somedays
No, I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along, and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me
Now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning
I've been a loser all my life, I'm not about to change
If you don't like it, there's the door, nobody made you stay
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it
Just how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this
Well, I'm hating, all of this
I'm hating, all of this
All of this, all of this
Now I know why, I hide my love from you somedays
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me

But a lineup formed outside your door, and I was way too late
Well, I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place
Because somewhere, the one I wanna be with's with somebody else
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with
(I wanna be that someone that you're with)
And I can talk about it all day long 'till I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with
(I've got to be that someone that you're with)
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss
God, I wanna be that someone that you're with
Well, I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday
And I borrow things that I don't need for conversation sake
Last night I heard your key, it hit your lock at 4 AM
Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them
Well, I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place
Because somewhere, the one I wanna be with's with somebody else
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with
(I wanna be that someone that you're with)
And I can talk about it all day long 'till I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with
(I've got to be that someone that you're with)
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss
God, I wanna be that someone that you're with
Because somewhere, the one I wanna be with's with somebody else
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with
And I can talk about it all day long 'till I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with
(I've got to be that someone that you're with)
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss
But God, I got to be that someone that...
I wanna be that someone that...
I've got to be that someone that you're with"
Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting),"It's getting late, I haven't seen my date
So tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a bar full of winos
And his old lady, she don't care
My sister lookin' cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a woman to see me right
I could use a little muscle to get what I need
I'll drink a fifth of Jack and scream out ""She's with me""
A couple of sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this town alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right

Horizon,"I wish that when you walked in, I could hide it
I wish that when we touched, there wasn't lightnin'
You say you wish our hearts had better timin'
But somethin' always keeps us from collidin'
'Cause one of us is always holdin' somebody else
While one of us is hoping that nobody could tell
And the both of us are gettin' good at foolin' ourselves
Waitin' on the other one to figure it out
So how long (How long) before (Before) the stars will all align?
Or am I (Am I) just chasing (Chasing) your love
Like it's just over the next horizon?
(Just over the next—)
I know you like the way you keep me captive
So what's it gonna take to make this happen? (To make this happen)
I lost my chance when you met him
I went through Hell and back again
But thank God there's no way to kick this habit
'Cause one of us is always holdin' somebody else
While one of us is hoping that nobody could tell
And the both of us are gettin' good at foolin' ourselves
Waitin' on the other one to figure it out
So how long (How long) before (Before) the stars will all align?
Or am I (Am I) just chasing (Chasing) your love
Like it's just over the next horizon?
Like it's just over the next horizon
Just over the next horizon
Can we close the distance between
Where we are and where we could be?
Never really as far as it seems
When it seems just like
One of us is always holdin' somebody else
While one of us is hopin' that nobody could tell
And the both of us are gettin' good at foolin' ourselves
Waitin' on the other one to figure it out
So how long (How long) before (Before) the stars will all align?
Or am I (Am I) just chasing (Chasing) your love

For the River,"Stuck in a cage, luck of the draw
Hours to wait, gotta get out
Lord, I gotta fight one
Get me a key, pick me a lock
Gotta be free, ready or not
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
Nowhere to hide 'cause someone's always gonna find you
Trying to breathe with everybody right behind you
Scattering leaves to try and cover up the footprints
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance
I'm running for the river
'Cause the river's running high and there ain't no goin' back
They'll never catch me
I'm running for the river
You can ride, you can fly, you can tell 'em that you tried
But there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
Tell 'em that you tried, but you're never gonna catch me
Let out the hounds, stand off the guards
Never be found, better than bars
""Damn it, he's a fast one""
Out of the tree's, into the swamp
Gotta be free, so don't ever stop
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
""God damn it, he's a fast one""
Nowhere to hide 'cause someone's always gonna find you

Kiss It Goodbye,"Kiss it goodbye, goodbye
Kiss it goodbye, goodbye
Hollywood is plastic
But easy on the eyes
Big Apple is fantastic
But cuts you down to size
They'll treat you like a doormat
Expecting you to fail
Says right across your forehead
Integrity for sale
You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
(Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it)
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself
That brunettes move to New York
Blondes love California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit when it's up above your eyes
(Kiss it goodbye)
Stealing comes with practice
Lying comes with ease
But neither one is faster
Than falling to your knees
Money leads to fame
And fame is the disease
The latest epidemic
Reality TV
You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
(Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it)
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself
That brunettes move to New York
Blondes love California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
They won't let you get out alive
Your ass, grab it, and kiss it goodbye
They won't let you get out alive
Your ass, grab it, and kiss it goodbye
And kiss it goodbye
(Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it)
So let's move to New York
Or out to California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
They won't let you get out alive
Your ass, grab it, and kiss it goodbye
They won't let you get out alive
Your ass, grab it, and kiss it goodbye"
Steel Still Rusts,"Best of days livin' a simple life
There's nowhere to go when there's only one stoplight
His grandmother told him ""Don't you dare sign up
They'll ship you away to places we ain't heard of
Get a degree, and maybe be a doctor
Just ask your daddy, it won't matter once they got ya""
Lifetimes you could spend to find out what she meant
Her final dyin' breath, this is what she said
""Long gone is the praise for those who fought for us
Ashes to ashes, turns out steel still rusts
Stone carved in your name, no one can really trust
Shoulder another soldier they stole from us
Don't ever bend, don't ever crawl
Supposed to stand and never fall
Long gone is the praise for those who fought for us
Ashes to ashes, turns out steel still rusts""
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Steel still rusts
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
A third of his life off in a foreign land
Thanks for your service, sincerely, Uncle Sam
Lost the best of friends he'd ever known
And no line of welcome signs once he got back home
He got a job, a doorman at a dive bar
Became a bodyguard, protecting famous rockstars
Lost count of the times he's been around the world
Promised grandmama he'd never lose these words
Long gone is the praise for those who fought for us
Ashes to ashes, turns out steel still rusts
Stone carved in your name, no one can really trust
Shoulder another soldier they stole from us
Don't ever bend, don't ever crawl
Supposed to stand and never fall
Long gone is the praise for those who fought for us
Ashes to ashes, turns out steel still rusts
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Steel still rusts
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
And dust to dust
Forever feel the wounds that never heal
When fallen friends are now a line of crosses in a field
Long gone is the praise for those who fought for us
Ashes to ashes, turns out steel still rusts (Steel still rusts)
Stone carved in your name, no one can really trust
Shoulder another soldier they stole from us
Don't ever bend, don't ever crawl
Supposed to stand and never fall (And never fall)
Long gone is the praise for those who fought for us
Ashes to ashes, turns out steel still rusts
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Steel still rusts (Steel still rusts)
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Steel still rusts"

Bottoms Up,"Hey
Who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky?
I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit till it's dry

Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up
Drinking every drop until it all runs out
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up
Ooh, bottoms up
So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire
We're drinking black tooth, 80 proof, straight gasoline
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up

This Means War,"Climb into the ring for a battle that you can't win
Swing as hard as you can swing, it will still mean nothing
Should’ve seen it coming, it had to happen sometime
But you went and brought a knife to an all out gun fight
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave
You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war
Say anything you want, but talk will get you nowhere
The only thing you've brought was psychological warfare
Well, there’s no getting out
And now you gotta wonder
Who will dig you out when you’re six feet under?
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave
You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave
You’ve gone too far
Who do you think you are?

The Betrayal (Act I),
Gotta Get Me Some,"I went out on the town with a friend last weekend
His ex-girlfriend's friend was there alone
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling
She could really handle alcohol
Another one down and headed off the deep end
The more we drank, the less that we had on
And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar
Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some
God almighty, look at that body
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun
Hotter than a barrel on a squeezed machine gun
Well, she can get lower than a Maserati
Never seen somebody move that way
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party
Everybody wants to know her name
And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar
Looking like a rock star, and she likes to go out and
Get her hands on
Anything to stand on
Anything to dance on
And she'd be swinging around
Under the hot lights, underneath the spotlight
Even going all night
She'll be the talk of the town, you know
She's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some
God almighty, look at that body
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari

Standing in the Dark,"The needle on my compass must be busted or bent 'cause I can't walk straight
And I'm feelin' kinda beaten like the rusted out hinges on the backyard gate
Well, everybody lies too much
Hoping they can find true love
'Cause hell is what we all go through
To try and find an angel like you
Woah-oh
Well, thank God you found me (Found me)
Because I'm broken and handing you my heart
When the night is surrounding
Need your light around me
Or else I'm just standing in the dark
When the night is surrounding
Need your light around me
Or еlse I'm just standing in the dark

Your turn to breathe as the shadows drift away

Of all the pain that the world will never know

Your turn to breathe as the shadows drift away
You can't explain, you just let go

It's not a problem, you can borrow mine

That I could throw away regret
It doesn't matter what we do
As long as I can be with you
So come and run away with me
You're gonna love it, wait and see
Forever we can live like that

Got Me Runnin’ Round,"Wake up
My baby still looks amazing with no makeup
And dammit I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers
Said ""I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother""
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country
And now we're buying diamonds
Saying it's only 20 karats, it can't be that hard to find it, baby

Keep up with what you doing
Ain't nothing wrong girl

My misses still eat McDonald's, taste delicious
Primadonna, not this one, so I guess she'll get it
Work my kisses
Work my britches
Every nickel back pays a visit
To my baby girl, my baby, yeah
Run around town on a treadmill
I ain't going nowhere
No underwear, that's what she wears
Thought a Playmate wanna join the party
She responds to me like, ""Hugh Heff?""
Birthday cake, wanna grant my wishes
Every day I'm losing my breath
Can't replace that face, that waist

First on the bad list, and you're last on mine
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you
I still hear him screaming ""Where do I hide?""
And he asks and I say ""Hurry inside""
He said, she said, no she don't
Be back before morning, You know she won't
I remember that summer, like yesterday
And I remember his mother, as he was dragged away
I still hear him screaming ""Where do I hide?""
And he asks and I say ""Hurry inside""
A whole lot of memories, yours and not mine
And he asks and I say ""Hurry inside""
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you
I still hear him screaming ""Where do I hide?""
And he asks and I say ""Hurry inside""
A whole lot of memories, yours and not mine
And he asks and I say ""Hurry inside""
""Where do I hide?"""
Tidal Wave,"Loving you is just like surfing on a tidal wave
Driftin' through the night, inhibition slips away
Shifting with the tide, hiding from the light of day
Letting go, take control over me
Undertow, getting pulled underneath
(Loving you)
Loving you is just like surfing on a tidal wave
Lost in one another, hopin' never to be found (Loving you)
Loving you is just like surfing on a tidal wave
Rollin' 'round forever 'til we both come crashin' down (Loving you)
Loving you is just like surfing on a tidal wave
Coming up for air, I swear, we're just about to drown (Loving you)
Loving you is just like surfing on a tidal wave
Heavy on my mind, levee's breaking currently
Never thought that I'd find myself so lost at sеa
Letting go, take control over mе
Undertow, getting pulled underneath
(Loving you)
Loving you is just like surfing on a tidal wave
Lost in one another, hopin' never to be found (Loving you)
Loving you is just like surfing on a tidal wave

Midnight Queen,"I'm in a bar full of bikers and a handful of junkies
It's a 50-50 chance that they're planning to jump me
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive
Oh! Well, my favorite little waitress has a hold on my eye
But there's a shotgun loaded hidden under the bar
Her finger's on the trigger if anybody gets outta line
There's other places that are better to go
But I'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen
(Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!)
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean
(She's got a hold on me and ain't letting go)
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
Well, she walks like a model and she talks like a trucker
Doesn't want a lollipop, but she sure loves a sucker
They're closing in around her, I'm cutting to the front of the line
Oh! She's got a bottle of Tequila and a lime for her lips
Lay that body on the bar and put that salt on her hips
I was lying when I told her that I'm only gonna lick her tonight!
There's other places that are better to go
But I'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen
(Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!)
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean
(She's got a hold on me and ain't letting go)
She's gonna be, my, sex machine
(And I can never get her under control)
She's gonna climb all over me
(I'm like a pony in my own rodeo)
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
And I can't get enough of the things that she does
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen
(Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!)
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean
(She's got a hold on me and ain't letting go)
She's gonna be, my, sex machine

She's gonna climb all over me

Sister Sin,"Well, the lady and me both agree some days we just don't get along
But the whiskey and me both agree maybe we're both just better off
Well, the preacher believes I don't need all of these demons hanging on
But we both know if they don't, I'll get lonely, need a few to tag along
Hanging here by a thread
Hear your voice inside my head
I lay beside you every night
And dread the day you might be gone
She said, ""In case you hadn't noticed that
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
And I ain't about to anymore""
Yeah
Well, the wagon I'm in is paper thin
I think one wheel's coming off
Hey sister sin with that grin, where you been?
So kind of you to help me off
Hanging here by a thread
Hear your voice inside my head
I lay beside you every night
And dread the day you might be gone
She said, ""In case you hadn't noticed that
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
And I ain't about to anymore""
Fall from grace, kingdom come
Laying face down in the mud
Please don't hate, Lord don't judge
For I know not just what I've done
Fall from grace, kingdom come
Laying face down in the mud
Please don't hate, Lord don't judge

Don’t Ever Let It End,"Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't ever, don't ever let it end
Well, I've got two tickets to the game
It'd be great if I could take you to it this Sunday
And I'll walk you home when the whole thing's done
If you're there, I don't even care which team won
We can stop at the coffee shop
And make fun of the cops in the parking lot
We can laugh as we both pretend
That we're not in love and that we're just good friends
Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you, there's nothing I could do to ever let it end
And you know I feel the same way
'Cause I told you drunk on my birthday
And as you pulled to me
You whispered in my ear, ""Don't ever let it end""
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't ever, don't ever let it end
Saturday, I'm gonna take her out
Cause her favorite band is going to play downtown
Gonna sing the song we've all heard of
About those two young friends that should've fell in love
Later on, we'll cut through the park
And she can hold my hand, 'cause she hates the dark
And we can laugh as we both pretend
That we're not in love and that we're just good friends
Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you, there's nothing I could do to ever let it end

You whispered in my ear, ""Don't ever let it end""
Don't let it end (Please promise me that this won't end)
Don't let it end
Don't ever, don't ever let it end
The greatest times we ever had
It's crazy now just looking back, we can laugh
You never know where life's gonna go
'Cause we're the only ones who'll ever know
About Sunday night, just her and I
Sitting side by side in the full moonlight
I pulled her close, just to hold her tight
And the both of us could tell it just felt right
She looked at me in the sweetest way
Like she could tell what the hell I was about to say
Must've took a while just to find the words
'Cause she cut me off and finally said it first
Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you, there's nothing I could do to ever let it end
And you know I feel the same way
'Cause I told you drunk on my birthday
And as you pulled to me
You whispered in my ear, ""Don't ever let it end""

Throw Yourself Away,"Baby's born on a bathroom floor

And hide it all until the day you die
Your secret's safe, at least you thought it was
You can only keep it for a little while
And now you're terrified
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?
You know they're gonna burn it down

And damn you for thinking we would never mind
Only reason that you made it this far
You never asked him, but you never tried
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away?

Holding on to Heaven,"And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on and hold on
I keep listening to my chest
For a beat, but there's nothing left
It's been a week since I’ve seen you
And I still can’t believe it
'Cause I'm dying inside, alone
And every day we gotta be apart
I'm like a baby with a broken heart
But the second that I see you
You will know how much I need you
'Cause I'll never be letting you go
(Now you know I)
I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You're the one I can't go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
I've got you now and
I'm not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It's like I'm holding on to heaven
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I'll hold on, and hold on
And if I could write a symphony
Then baby, you would be my melody
And you would flow like a river
Slowly going on forever
Like a feather that’s blowing away
Like everyone that needs a fairy tale
Like every mother's love that never fails
Like every game that needs a player
Every sinner needs a savior
I'm the villain you're willing to save
(Now you know why)
I'm lost without you
And there's nothing I can do
You're the one I can't go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever

Never be together long enough

It's like I'm holding on to heaven

What I'm waiting for will wash this pain away

Should’ve Listened,"There's clothes all over the floor

Smell of perfume isn't here

And still I don't understand
No pictures left in the hall
There's three new holes in my wall
Where the hell's my credit cards? Why's my wallet in the yard?
And still I don't understand
Well, now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other, why's love gotta be so tough?
Should see the look on my face
My shit's all over the place
Why's this happening to me? Why'd you take both sets of keys?
And still I don't understand
Well, now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other, why's love gotta be so tough?
Oh, now I guess I should've listened

In one ear and out the other, why must life be so tough?

In one ear and out the other, why's love gotta be so tough?"
The Hammer’s Coming Down,"Where will you be when the sky comes down?
And what would you do if the strength was found?
Stay right beside me when the ground starts shaking

This is the red sky morning

The hammer's coming down (down)
The hammer's coming
Once it's started, there's no turning back
But I'll be with you when the sun turns black
'Cause finding faith will always be the hardest
While you're standing in the heart of darkness
If there is one thing I can promise you
We'll see the light again
This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky morning
Without warning now
This is the fight that we've been waiting for

Good Times Gone,"Lost it on the chesterfield

And all that shit we've done
Where the good times gone?
Well, I still don't know
Out in the back in the old corn field
Underneath the tractor wheel
Thought I'd dig, till I'd found it first
Broke my back and died of thirst
You can bribe the devil, you can pray to God
You can sell off everything you got
And you still won't know
Where the good times gone?
Where the good times gone?
All the stupid fun
And all that shit we've done
Where the good times gone?
Well, I still don't know

Preacher says, ""Don't know what it means""
Last page ad in a comic book
Bought me a map, showed me where to look
It ain't carved of stone or made of wood
And if you paid for it, then it ain't no good
